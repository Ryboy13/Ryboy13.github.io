	<p> Theres something that feels so organic and exciting about backcountry camping- packing everything you need for a night or two into a bag, strapping it on to your back, and heading into the wilderness to find a campsite.
        It can, however, be confusing to know what you need to pack and even when you understand the basics, it can feel overwhelming to figure out, in a marketplace full of countless contraptions, what kinds of equipment are actually worth your investment.
    Listed below are a few basic items to get you started!</p>

				<p>We like to encourage every outdoor enthusiast to use their gear for as long as possible as a way to reduce waste and minimize our environmental footprint. However, when there’s absolutely no hope in repairing your damaged, beat-up, and well-worn gear it’s good to make an investment and buy new. But we are well aware that new gear can be very expensive and purchasing products at full price isn’t always in the budget. On the flip side, it can also seem risky to go for used or discounted outdoor gear if you don’t know where to look.
                We’ve been there before too and discovered that the world of discounted and used gear isn’t as scary as you might think. In fact, hunting down good quality, cheap outdoor gear is pretty simple and fun — let’s be honest, there’s nothing like scoring a great deal!
